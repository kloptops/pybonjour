Introduction
------------

pybonjour provides a pure-Python interface (via ctypes) to Apple
Bonjour and compatible DNS-SD libraries (such as Avahi).  It allows
Python scripts to take advantage of Zero Configuration Networking
(Zeroconf) to register, discover, and resolve services on both local
and wide-area networks.  Since pybonjour is implemented in pure
Python, scripts that use it can easily be ported to Mac OS X, Windows,
Linux, and other systems that run Bonjour.

Currently does not play well with Avahi. :(

pybonjour is free software, distributed under the MIT license.

Requirements
------------

pybonjour now requires Python 2.6 or later.  It also depends on ctypes, which is
part of the standard library since Python 2.5 so that is no longer a worry.

No additional software is required to use pybonjour under Mac OS X. To use it
under Windows, the Bonjour for Windows package must be installed on your system.
Most Linux systems use Avahi rather than Bonjour for DNS-SD. If this is the case
on your system, you'll need to install Avahi's Bonjour compatibility library.
(Under Ubuntu, the package to install is libavahi-compat-libdnssd1.)  Otherwise,
or to use pybonjour under other POSIX systems, you must download, compile, and
install Bonjour from source.

Both the Bonjour for Windows package and the latest Bonjour source code are
available for download at

  http://developer.apple.com/networking/bonjour/download/

* Not sure they're still available there...

Documentation
-------------

pybonjour provides extensive online documentation, which can be
accessed from the Python prompt via 'help(pybonjour)'.  In addition,
the examples directory contains scripts that demonstrate basic usage
of the module.
